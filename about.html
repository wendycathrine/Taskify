        <p>A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. 
            That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because 
            youve written your to-dos down doesnt mean your to-do list is actually useful. 
            Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done. 
            But too often, that list of work to-dos is disorganized and disconnected from the actual 
            work youre doing—which leads to less clarity and more work about work.</p>

                <p>Most typically, they are organised in order of priority. Traditionally, 
                    they are written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid. 
                    As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets, 
                    word documents. Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means 
                    you shouldnt forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order 
                    in which you are going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what 
                    tasks you can leave until a little later.
