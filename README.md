# Task Management To-Do List

This is a simple task management to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as view tasks categorized as pending, in progress, or completed.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page. It includes placeholders for the task list and buttons to create, edit, and delete tasks. This file also links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the web page, including styles for the task list, buttons, and task statuses (pending, in progress, completed).

3. `scripts.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the functionality of the task management application. It includes functions to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as rendering tasks on the web page.

## Usage

To use the task management to-do list application:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. You will see the task management to-do list interface with an empty task list and buttons to create tasks.

4. Click on the "Create Task" button to add a new task. Fill in the details of the task and click "Save" or "Create" to add it to the task list.

5. Each task will be displayed with buttons to edit or delete it. Click on the "Edit" button to modify the task details or the "Delete" button to remove the task from the list.

6. Tasks are categorized as pending, in progress, or completed based on their status. The background color of each task indicates its status.

7. You can customize the styles and functionality of the task management to-do list by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files as needed.

## Sample Tasks

The task list initially contains sample tasks for demonstration purposes. You can replace these sample tasks with your own tasks or fetch tasks from a database or API.
